In fact, that's how this site is currently published to Github pages!</p>

<p>The interesting obstacle was pushing to Github from inside of a docker container. While typically this requires SSH private keys, it turns out you can authenticate with your username and password over HTTPS. Even better, you can use a <a href='https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use' >Github access token</a>. By using this token in the URL, we can achieve HTTP authentication as so: </p>

<pre><code>https://&lt;token&gt;@github.com/&lt;user&gt;/&lt;repo&gt;.git
</code></pre>

<p>Note that there is no password required, and you had better use https! This still isn't as secure as SSH, but it allowed me to build a container that can be run without requiring any user-specific data inside the container, as so: </p>

<pre><code>$ sudo docker run hamiltont/btest --token &lt;my_token&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, no users will accidentally push their private key to the Docker index! It's not perfect--the token may be exposed in log files and process lists for any users with sudo powers. </p>

<p>My final annoyance is that GitPython seems to be unable to read the user properly from inside a Docker containter. I "fixed" it by setting an environment variable, but I suspect there is a better method...</p>]]></description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/ghostbuster-containment/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5026dd37-2a89-4b9b-b9e4-128d905eb5d3</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Hamilton Turner]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2014 05:30:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[&quot;Metadock&quot; and Containers-As-A-VM]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>After seeing <a href='http://blog.docker.io/2013/09/docker-can-now-run-within-docker/' >docker in docker</a>, I can't help but think about the ongoing debate of "can you use a container like a VM?" Some very clever people advocate process isolation as a main point of Docker<sup><a href='https://twitter.com/jpetazzo/status/435833462335877120'  title="jpetazzo twitter">2</a></sup>, while others want an environment where "docker run" becomes a substitute for "start these 4 services and setup SSH+VNC for my development IDE"<sup><a href='http://tech.paulcz.net/2013/10/managing-docker-services-with-this-one-easy-trick.html'  title="logstash">1</a></sup>. While I think both usage scenarios can contribute back to the Docker community at large, non-experts are hopelessly lost on how to properly setup a container-as-a-vm (or when that is/is not justified). Continued clever work from the Docker team can potentially avoid what I see as largely unmaintainable voodoo 'baseimage' setups<sup><a href='http://phusion.github.io/baseimage-docker/' >3</a></sup>. </p>

<p>Specifically, I wonder if we will see containers that exist solely to orchestrate other containers. Sure, there's a lot left to lock down (integrate advanced networking<sup><a href='https://github.com/jpetazzo/pipework' >4</a></sup>, remove need for sudo, and many others), but I am excited to isolated an entire environment of containers inside a parent and control entire environment memory and CPU usage.</p>]]></description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/thoughts-on-metadock-and-containers-as-a-vm/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">98c1fe56-ee3b-4dbf-b027-ecbd0d57c4c4</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Hamilton Turner]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2014 18:27:50 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
